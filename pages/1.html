      <h2>Why Should You Learn Music Theory?</h2>

      <p>
        There are world-class guitar virtuosos who know little of music theory. Many new guitar players who see strange diagrams or dots and lines don’t believe these to be relevant. Amateur players often reject music theory as useless.

        The study of music theory is not optional; it is necessary.
      </div>

      <p>
        All musicians develop systems to understand how music works. These systems can be formal or informal. As soon as a musician begins to interact with others, having shared understanding becomes important.
